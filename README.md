# IoT-Labs-2018
IoT labs for Institut Galil√©e and Efrei students

# Description

* This project implements a simple collect-transmit schema. An ESP32 will be responsible of collecting measures from one or optionally multiple sensors, then send them to a server, in the same local network.

* Communication is based on the Light-weight Internet Protocol [(LwIP)](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) stack, which is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite that has been initially developed by Adam Dunkels. This library is provided along with the ESP-IDF, so no need to include it.

# Get the latest updates
It is strongly recommended that you clone the repository rather than downloading it. This way, you can get latest updates easily. You can use for that the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/HamidiMassinissa/iot-lab-2018.git
```
Getting latest updates:

```
$ git pull origin master
```

# Evaluation
## Minimal project
Source code is provided but there are missing parts that you have to complete. These missing parts are those indicated with a comment of the form `// TODO failwith "Students, this is you job!"` or this instuction, `rc = ENOSYS;`. Note that `ENOSYS` is the POSIX error code for "Function not implemented".

Your job then, is to complete the missing parts in order to get the ESP32 collect measures from the `BME280`, format and send them correctly to the server via HTTP/TCP/IPv4/WiFi stack.

## Extensions
Here you have a list of possible extensions that you can implement. Note that there is no implicit order at all in the following list!
### Connecting Multiple Sensors
### i2c Communication
Implementing sensor readings over i2c serial communication protocol.
### Application Protocols
Add support for MQTT and CoAP application protocols. You can make use of any available library.
### Implementing Transmissions over BLE
Take a look at `phy_layer.c`.
### Secure Communication
ESP-IDF allow to perform secure communication through `mbedtls` library. This library provides an implementation of the TLS and SSL protocols and the respective cryptographic algorithms and support code required. Take a look [here](https://tls.mbed.org/kb/how-to/mbedtls-tutorial) for instructions to get started with `mbedtls` and [here](https://tls.mbed.org/api/ssl_8h.html) for the API.
### Network Protocols
Add support for 6LowPAN, which is the adaptation layer used to send IPv6 packets over constrained physical interfaces like BLE, ZigBee (802.15.4), etc.
### Handle Limited Queue Size
Measures read from sensors are placed into a global queue (`sensor_readings_queue`), take a look at `transmission.h`, in order to be sent later by the `perform_transmissions` task. The size of the queue being limited, what should you do when it becomes full, when for example, connexion is broken temporarily? One solution is to get rid of old measures, not satisfactory. Another solution is to exploit the capabilities of the ESP32 which provides a virtual file system that allow you to persist data in the flash memory.

# Submission Instructions
comming soon ...

# Get involved
Some protocols, like Multipath-TCP, UDP-Light, are in experimental status and not yet included in LwIP. If you want to be involved in Free Software development for Internet of Things, this constitutes a good starting point.
